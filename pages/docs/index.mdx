# Moving Platform Maker 2D

The best Unity asset to help you create 2D moving platforms without coding.

## Demos

The demo scenes were inspired by Super Mario World's levels to showcase the use of moving platforms. You can play them online:
- [Donut Plains](/demos/donutplains/index.html)
- [Forest fortress](/demos/forestfortress/index.html)

## Development version

Our default branch is for the development of the new version of the asset and requires Unity  2022.3.13f1 or greater.

There are specific branches for each LTS version of Unity supported and those currently contain the released versions of the asset.


## Quick start

Download it directly from Unity's asset store, the best version for your current Unity version is automatically chosen and you will receive notifications when it is updated.

For development, clone the repo into your project's `Assets` folder. It should create a folder called `MovingPlatformMaker2D`.


## Contributing

You can contribute by forking this repo and submitting a PR.

- Check if there's already an issue open before opening a new issue
- Add as much detail as possible, unity version, steps to reproduce
- Isolate the problem by reproducing it in a new empty scene
